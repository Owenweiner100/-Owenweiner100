## Hello there
  I am a sophomore at Buffalo State University. I major in [Computer Science](https://cis.buffalostate.edu/) and I am declaring a [Technical Writing Certificate](https://suny.buffalostate.edu/news/technical-writing-certificate-prepares-students-careers-strong-outlook).
  
  Currently, I am learning about HTML, CSS and programming. I use Visual Studio Code for HTML/CSS and I use either Dev C++ or CodeBlocks for programming.
